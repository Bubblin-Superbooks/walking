  But never found any;
  Where sometimes Martial Miles
  Singly files,
  And Elijah Wood,
  I fear for no good:
  No other man,
  Save Elisha Dugan—
  O man of wild habits,
  Partridges and rabbits,
  Who hast no cares
  Only to set snares,
  Who liv’st all alone,
  Close to the bone;
  And where life is sweetest
