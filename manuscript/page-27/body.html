<p>   When the spring stirs my blood
    With the instinct to travel,
    I can get enough gravel
   On the Old Marlborough Road.
      Nobody repairs it,
      For nobody wears it;
      It is a living way,
      As the Christians say.
   Not many there be
    Who enter therein,
   Only the guests of the
    Irishman Quin.
   What is it, what is it
    But a direction out there,
   And the bare possibility
      Of going somewhere?
      Great guide boards of stone,
      But travelers none;
      Cenotaphs of the towns
      Named on their crowns.
      It is worth going to see
      Where you <em>might</em> be.
      What king
      Did the thing,
      I am still wondering;
      Set up how or when,
      By what selectmen,
      Gourgas or Lee,
      Clark or Darby?
      Theyâ€™re a great endeavor
      To be something forever;
      Blank tablets of stone,
      Where a traveler might groan,
      And in one sentence
     </blockquote></div> </div>
